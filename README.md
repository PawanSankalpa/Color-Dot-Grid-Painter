🎨 Turtle Dot Art Generator
Welcome to the Turtle Dot Art Generator – a fun little Python project that uses the Turtle graphics module to create a vibrant grid of colorful dots. Inspired by pointillism and digital pixel art, this script draws a 14x14 dot matrix with randomly selected colors from a beautiful preset palette.

🐢 What It Does
This program uses Python’s turtle module to:

Set up a canvas with RGB color support.

Move the turtle cursor (invisible to keep the artwork clean).

Randomly choose colors from a hand-picked list of RGB values.

Paint a neatly spaced grid (14 rows × 14 columns) of colorful dots.

Exit the drawing window when you click on it.

✨ Features
Predefined Color Palette: A set of 25 vibrant RGB colors to keep the artwork fresh and visually pleasing.

Efficient Movement: The turtle is set to “fastest” speed for quick rendering.

Grid Layout: Dots are evenly spaced and perfectly aligned.

Randomized Colors: Each dot's color is picked randomly, making every run unique.

Easy to Exit: Click anywhere on the screen to close the window.

🧠 How It Works
The turtle starts in a slightly shifted position to center the drawing on the screen.

It draws one row at a time by placing a dot, moving forward, and repeating.

After finishing a row, it moves up and starts the next row.

This repeats for 14 rows, forming a complete grid of 196 colorful dots.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

No additional libraries needed – just the built-in turtle and random modules.

🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.

Copy the code into a .py file (e.g., dot_art.py).

Run the script using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python dot_art.py
Enjoy the artwork! Click the screen to close it when you're done.

🖌️ Why Use This?
It’s perfect if you’re learning Python and want to:

Practice using turtle

Work with RGB colors

Understand basic movement and drawing logic

Just have fun generating cool visual patterns!
